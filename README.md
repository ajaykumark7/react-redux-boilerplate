Inspired by the brilliant, short tutorial from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sX3KeP7v7Kg

Overview of steps to be followed:
1. Connect the component to redux store & rewrite all .state calls to .props calls
2. Write your mapStateToProps() function
3. Create the store
4. Create the reducer
5. Wrap whichever component needs access to redux store inside '<Provider>' component
6. Create the dispatchers
